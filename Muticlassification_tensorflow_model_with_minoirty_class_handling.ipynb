The reason the noted in the communication was that \" they show I have high utilization of other credit accounts. \\'\\' I take offense to this tactic of taking adverse action on a long time customer who is in good standing. During a crisis where all institutions, including Citi, say they are here to help and this is how I am treated. My credit utilization has been the same for the recent 2-3 years and I am current on all of my credit accounts, mortgage and car loans. Nothing is past due. To impact my credit line, charge a late fee during a global pandemic is unacceptable. Also, on this account, I have not used it recently - which should be viewed as me being responsible and paying down this debt and other debts. My high utilization will be further impacted by Citi reducing my credit line, which in turn will show me at a higher credit utilization for this account and my overall credit profile in general. I think it is an unfair practice. I am requesting that Citi reverse this decision, restore my account, which is in good standing and paid current, never past due.

This has also negatively impacted my credit score. I had not received any invoices or anything regarding debts owed from monitrinics. I asked for Proof if this debt and all I received was a copy of an agreement from XXXX. I do not owe this company anything. \\nComplaint Type : Billing/Collection Issues Status : Unresolved XX/XX/XXXX I have never done business with this company and they have placed me for collection with a company called XXXX. I have never had or used anything from a company called XXXX. This business places scam accounts on your file to bully you into paying a balance and never belonged to a person in the first place. They blatantly fail to adhere to the Fair Credit Act and refuse to provide ANY single document that proves their false allegation that a person owes what they allege. This is a scam. All companies are bound by the Fair Credit Act and thi THESE COMPLAINTS GO ON AND ON I'M ASKING TO HAVE THIS COMPANY INVESTIGATED AND ALSO REVIEW THE 202 COMPLAINTS FILED JUST IN THE MONTH OF XXXX. I HAVE CONTINUED TO CONACT XXXX   THRU WRITING WHICH THERE HAS BEEN NOT ONE RESPONSE. I HAVE CONTACTED AT THIS POINT AN ATTORNEY TO ALSO ASSIST ME WITH THIS MATTER.\"\n",

When I logged in and saw that I was past due I immediately made the payment. They charged a late fee. Also, within the same week, they sent me a notification that my credit line was decreased. The reason the noted in the communication was that \" they show I have high utilization of other credit accounts. \\'\\' I take offense to this tactic of taking adverse action on a long time customer who is in good standing. During a crisis where all institutions, including Citi, say they are here to help and this is how I am treated. My credit utilization has been the same for the recent 2-3 years and I am current on all of my credit accounts, mortgage and car loans. Nothing is past due. To impact my credit line, charge a late fee during a global pandemic is unacceptable. Also, on this account, I have not used it recently - which should be viewed as me being responsible and paying down this debt and other debts. My high utilization will be further impacted by Citi reducing my credit line, which in turn will show me at a higher credit utilization for this account and my overall credit profile in general. I think it is an unfair practice. I am requesting that Citi reverse this decision, restore my account, which is in good standing and paid current, never past due.
